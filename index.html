            <h2 id="headline">Early life</h2>
            <p>
                Covington was born in Clovis, California on February 22, 1988.
                His parents are Noelle and Brad Covington, and he has two sisters 
                named Candace and Callie. The family moved from California to 
                Oregon when he was eight years old. His father was a wrestler 
                during his time at the Oregon Institute of Technology and 
                Southern Oregon University.
            </p>
            <h2 id="headline">Wrestling career</h2>
            <p>As a wrestler at Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon, Covington
               lettered all four years and won the 171 lb state championship as a senior. 
               He committed to Arizona State University but his test scores were not up 
               to par, so he went to Iowa Central Community College, where he won the 
               165 lb national junior college wrestling title as a true freshman with a 
               34–0 record. His roommate, at the time, was future UFC champion Jon Jones.
               <br>
               Following his championship season at Iowa Central, Covington transferred 
               to the noted wrestling program at the University of Iowa. On August 10, 2007, 
               he was arrested for eluding police and driving under the influence, having 
               registered a BAC of 0.255, over three times the legal limit of 0.08. He later 
               said, "That was a real all-time low in my life, something I really wish I could 
               take back." Due to his arrest, Covington was suspended from the Hawkeyes for a 
               year, and saw limited time the next season. He looked for a fresh start, and former 
               Hawkeyes coach Jim Zalesky convinced Covington to transfer to Oregon State University.
               <br>
                During his time at OSU, Covington qualified for the NCAA Tournament as a junior and 
                as a senior, placing fifth as a senior and earning All-American honors. 
                He also was a two-time Pac-10 Conference champion at 174-pounds. He was cited for 
                fourth-degree assault stemming from an incident on May 23, 2010 wherein he 
                was accused of punching two men after a verbal altercation. The Benton County 
                District Attorney's Office did not pursue charges against Covington over the incident.
                <br>
                Covington graduated with a bachelor's degree in Sociology in 2011</p>
