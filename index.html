          <p>
            Covington was born in Clovis, California on February 22, 1988. His
            parents are Noelle and Brad Covington, and he has two sisters named
            Candace and Callie. The family moved from California to Oregon when
            he was eight years old. His father was a wrestler during his time at
            the Oregon Institute of Technology and Southern Oregon University.

        <h2 id="headline">Wrestling career</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            As a wrestler at Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon,
            Covington lettered all four years and won the 171 lb state
            championship as a senior. He committed to Arizona State University
            but his test scores were not up to par, so he went to Iowa Central
            Community College, where he won the 165 lb national junior college
            wrestling title as a true freshman with a 34–0 record. His roommate,
            at the time, was future UFC champion Jon Jones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following his championship season at Iowa Central, Covington
            transferred to the noted wrestling program at the University of
            Iowa. On August 10, 2007, he was arrested for eluding police and
            driving under the influence, having registered a BAC of 0.255, over
            three times the legal limit of 0.08. He later said, "That was a real
            all-time low in my life, something I really wish I could take back."
            Due to his arrest, Covington was suspended from the Hawkeyes for a
            year, and saw limited time the next season. He looked for a fresh
            start, and former Hawkeyes coach Jim Zalesky convinced Covington to
            transfer to Oregon State University.
          </p>

          <p>
            During his time at OSU, Covington qualified for the NCAA Tournament
            as a junior and as a senior, placing fifth as a senior and earning
            All-American honors. He also was a two-time Pac-10 Conference
            champion at 174-pounds. He was cited for fourth-degree assault
            stemming from an incident on May 23, 2010 wherein he was accused of
            punching two men after a verbal altercation. The Benton County
            District Attorney's Office did not pursue charges against Covington
            over the incident.
          </p>

            Covington graduated with a bachelor's degree in Sociology in 2011.
            Covington faced Kamaru Usman for the UFC Welterweight Championship
            on December 14, 2019 at UFC 245. Covington sustained a left
            mandibular fracture as a result of a strike by Usman in the third
            round and was knocked down twice in the fifth round. The second
            knockdown was followed by a barrage of strikes by Usman with
            Covington covering up on the ground and subsequent stoppage by
            referee Marc Goddard resulting in technical knockout win for Usman.
            This fight earned him his first post fight bonus in the UFC for
            Fight of the Night. Going into the final round, one judge had
            Covington winning 39–37, another had it tied at 38-38, and the other
            had it 39–37 in favor of Usman
